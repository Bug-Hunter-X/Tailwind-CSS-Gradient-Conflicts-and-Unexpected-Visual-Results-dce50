# Tailwind CSS Gradient Conflicts
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS gradients: conflicts with other styling classes.  The `bug.html` file shows the problem, where a gradient is unexpectedly overwritten or combined with other styles, resulting in unexpected visual output.  The `solution.html` file offers a solution by prioritizing styles or using more specific selectors.
