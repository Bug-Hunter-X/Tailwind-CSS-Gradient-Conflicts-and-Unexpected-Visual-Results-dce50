```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality.  However, if the `...` contains classes that conflict with the gradient, it can cause unexpected visual results. For example, adding a `bg-red-500` class would overwrite the gradient, or adding a `text-white` class would only affect the text, not the background.
