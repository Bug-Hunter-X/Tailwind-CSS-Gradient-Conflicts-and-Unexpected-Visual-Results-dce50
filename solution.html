```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 relative">
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-red-500 opacity-50"></div>
</div>
```
This solution uses an `absolute` element positioned on top of the gradient with a partially transparent background. This allows the underlying gradient to show through while still applying the red overlay.
